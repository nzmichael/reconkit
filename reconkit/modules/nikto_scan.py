"""nikto: a classic web server scanner.

Nikto checks for thousands of known-dangerous files, outdated server software,
and common misconfigurations. It is LOUD (thousands of requests, an obvious
User-Agent) - it will show up in any web server log or intrusion detection
system. That's fine for authorized assessments, and a good lesson in why
attackers prefer quieter techniques.
